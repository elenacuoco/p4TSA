The core library is written in C++ and should be compiled before using the python interface.

The Python interface to the library is pyTSA (you can call it pi'za)
 
### What is this repository for? ###
p4TSA is a minimal package containing ad hoc function to work with time series. 
It includes
 * Whitening in time domain
 * Double Whitening (equivalent to dividing by Power Spectral density) in time domain
 * Wavelet decomposition
 * Wavelet Detection Filter

### How do I get set up? ###

* You need to have a python environment setup and some extralibrary (boost, FramLib,gsl,fftw3 installed)
* You should run cmake CMakeList.txt
* Dependencies: gsl, fftw3, gslcblas, Framelib
